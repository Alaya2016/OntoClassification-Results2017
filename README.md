# OntoClassification-Results2017
Evaluation Results of ontology reasoners conducted by Nourhene ALAYA using ORE Framework

ORE Framework output of the classification of 1965 ontologies processed by 10 reasoners

We reused the ORE'2015 Framework to conduct a new ontology classification challenges. 1965 ontologies from DL and EL profiles were used. 
They were processed by 10 well known reasoners. The details of the evaluation environement as well as reasoners and ontologies are given in the following:

_Date: January 2017

_Reasonning Task: Classification

_Reasoners: (available for download from https://zenodo.org/record/50738#.WRhPVVXyjcc)

_Ontologies: (available for download from https://zenodo.org/record/18578#.WReUzlXyjcc  and https://zenodo.org/record/50737#.WReW01Xyjcc)

TrainSet (1500 ontos), TestSet (465 ontos)

_Timeout: 180000 ms

_Memory limit: 8GB

_Hardware Description: • Intel Core I7-4470 CPU@3,4GHz x 8 • Java version 1.7.0_18 • 32GB RAM, 12GB RAM are given for each the reasoner

_ The file ORE2017_Ranking_TestTrainOntos_ALAYA.xls describs the classification runtime and termination state label for each reasoner 
and for every processed ontology. The file contains also the feature vectors computed for every ontology in the train and test sets.
